# mental health chat server beta

## Tools used:

- ChatGPT API
- Embedbase to help use VectorDB's and Embedding Models without hosting them
- Nextra for documentation (allows using NextJS, tailwlindCSS and MDX (Markdown + React)).
  - Alternatively could use pgvector and supabase's embedding models + edge functions for similar end goal, but wanted to try new tools
